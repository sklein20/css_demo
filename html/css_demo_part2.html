        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
            versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h3>This is Div 2</h3>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece 
            of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, 
            a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin 
            words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical 
            literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
            "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book 
            is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original 
            form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

        <h3>This is Div 3</h3>
        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in 
            some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going 
            to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

        <p class="idk">They’re preparing for new changes Apple has to 
            implement after a federal judge ruled in September 
            that Apple has to let app developers link to 
            alternate payment systems. The ruling came as 
            a result of a legal battle between Apple and Epic 
            Games, the maker of Fortnite.

            The new software, if adopted widely by 
            developers and users, could threaten Apple’s 
            profit engine. The App Store is part of the 
            company’s services business, which reported 
            $53.8 billion in sales during fiscal 2020 at a 
            66% gross margin, accounting for about 20% of 
            Apple’s revenue.</p>
